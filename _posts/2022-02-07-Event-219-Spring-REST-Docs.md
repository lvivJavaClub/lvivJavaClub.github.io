This week on Java Club we will review the Spring REST Docs. It combines hand-written documentation written with Asciidoctor and auto-generated snippets produced with Spring MVC Test. This approach frees you from the limitations of the documentation produced by tools like Swagger.
Join us next Thursday, at 10:00 Online
